Snake Game
A simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

Overview
This project recreates the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake that grows longer each time it eats an apple. The game features:

Snake Movement: Control the snake with the arrow keys.
Apple Eating: When the snake's head touches an apple, the snake grows longer and a new apple appears at a random location.
Screen Wrapping: The snake reappears on the opposite side of the canvas when it goes off one edge.
Score Display: The score is updated based on the number of apples eaten (i.e., the snakeâ€™s length minus one).
